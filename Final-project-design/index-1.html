        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>

        <div class="about1"><img src="../Final-project-design-review-2/aboutdog.jpg"></div>

        <div class="about-first-box"><p>Among the primary purposes of 4 Paws Kiddo Rescue is to help dogs 
            n need of socialization and medical care find these things, and then help them to find healthy 
            permanent homes. Secondarily it’s to find dogs in need of homes and match them up with people 
            looking for specific types of dogs. While their main focus is on small to medium sized dogs, 
            they’ve also been able to place large dogs with appropriate new owners as well. At times they’ve 
            even been able to find homes for cats.</p></div>

            <h2>The Founders</h2>

        <div class="aboutbox"><p>Virginie and Ed started 4 Paws Kiddo Rescue in 2018 after decades 
            of separately working in several different aspects of Animal Rescue as transporters, 
            caretakers, volunteers and whatever <span id="dots">...</span>other ways 
            that they found to <span id="more">contribute to the needs of animals as they saw them. Realizing that they shared 
            a vision of how best they could involve themselves in the rescue needs of animals they choose to try and implement 
            that vision together.</span></p><button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">Read More</button></div>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

        <div class="boxread1"><p>While the goal of the Rescue is to place all the animals into good homes, if a dog they rescue can’t 
            find a placement they’re never given up for lost. Both of them host a large number of animals in 
            their homes and will do so for the rest of the animals’ lives if necessary. For Virginie and Ed it’s 
            not only a moral imperative but a great source of joy. They’ll both continue to provide these services 
            for years and years to come.</p></div>
