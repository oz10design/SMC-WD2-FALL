                game by Santa Monica Studio and will be published by Sony.
                Loosely based in Norse mythology, the game will be set in ancient Norway and feature
                series protagonists Kratos and his teenage son Atreus. Serving as the finale 
                of the Norse era of the series, the game will cover Ragnarok, a series of events
                that bring about the end of the days and the death of the Norse gods.
