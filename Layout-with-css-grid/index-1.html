            <div class="grid-item green"></div>
            <div class="grid-item yellow"><p>Born in Sparta, Kratos was a respected soldier and a Spartan 
                General, up until he lost his wife and daughter when he killed them, albeit by accident, 
                under Ares' command, earning him the nickname of the "Ghost of Sparta", after which he 
                renounced his service to the War God, eventually killing him and ascending to Godhood by 
                becoming the new "God of War", before exacting revenge against his father, the Olympians 
                and the Titans who betrayed him.</p></div>
            <div class="grid-item red"><p>After successfully exacting his vengeance, Kratos escaped into the world of Norse Gods 
                by settling down in Midgard in Ancient Norway where he married another woman named Faye and 
                bore a son named Atreus who together, after the boy's motherâ€™s death, would embark on a 
                journey to spread her ashes at the highest peak of all the nine realms.</p></div>
