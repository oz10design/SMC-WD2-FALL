            <div class="grid-item yellow"><p>Atreus was conceived between the Greek demigod-turned-God of War, 
                Kratos and a JÃ¶tunn named Laufey, whom he called Faye. He was a sickly child and only recently 
                grew healthy enough to travel. Not much is known about his past other than the fact Kratos was 
                rarely home because he was practicing control over his rage, which Atreus misinterprets as hunting. 
                Faye had passed away sometime later, although the causes are still unknown.</p></div>
