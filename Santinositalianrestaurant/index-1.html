                <p>Cynthia Izzo the " foodie" creative half of the husband and wife team 
                    behind Santino's began her education Pizza - wise at age 3. For two 
                    months out of every year, her Aunt Lucy Cavazzi who traveled every year 
                    to the family home in Naples  Italy  and brought with her all the 
                    traditional  Italian recipes. Over the years Aunt Lucy travelled from 
                    Pittsburg, Pennsylvania where part of the family had settled and would 
                    come to visit her favorite niece in California where Cynthia's father 
                    was partner in one of the first Italian Trattoria in the San Fernardo 
                    valley</p> 

                <p>Aunt Lucy and Cynthia spent hours in the kitchen, cooking and preparing the 
                wide variety of delicious family recipes handed down through the ages. These 
                recipes comprised the regional specialties of Southern Italy, specifically the 
                regions in and around Naples. Lucy taught her how to make those fresh, full-bodied 
                tomato sauces ringing with garlic and herbs and rich with meats of various kinds. 
                Lucy taught her how to make pasta from scratch–egg noodles, tortellini, ravioli, 
                and other favorites of the Italian table. Cynthia was a good learner, listening 
                carefully to her aunt and learning how to cook in the style of the old world, 
                creating tantalizing flavors from simple ingredients.
                When she was old enough, Cynthia worked side by side with her cousins in the family 
                restaurant, known as Barone’s, the home of the famous thin crust square pizza. </p></div>

        <h3>The Square Origins</h3>
        <p>The origins of this pizza date back to antiquity when breads were baked in stone ovens then 
            brushed with olive oil and topped with tomatoes or whatever the harvest had to offer. Cynthia 
            loved the concept and also loved working with the public. During her years at Barone’s, she 
            learned the fine art of the Square  Pizza , ways of cooking and serving food that opened her 
            eyes to the wonders of the restaurant business. It gave her joy to see people sit down, relax, 
            eat well, leave happy and satisfied..</p>
