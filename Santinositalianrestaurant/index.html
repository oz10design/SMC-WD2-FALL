            <p>The origins of this pizza date back to antiquity when breads 
                were baked in stone ovens then brushed with olive oil and 
                topped with tomatoes or whatever the harvest had to offer. 
                Cynthia loved the concept and also loved working with the 
                public. During her years at Baroneâ€™s, she learned the fine 
                art of the Square  Pizza , ways of cooking and serving food 
                that opened her eyes to the wonders of the restaurant business. 
                It gave her joy to see people sit down, relax, eat well, leave 
                happy and satisfied</p></div>
