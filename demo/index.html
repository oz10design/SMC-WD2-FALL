        <p>In Nuenen, Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing. Working outside and very quickly,
           he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. Van Gogh also completed 
           The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen, which was stolen from the Singer Laren in March 2020. 
           From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined him 
           on his forays; she fell in love and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They 
           wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught 
           and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby 
           hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.</p>
        
        <p>Van Gogh painted several groups of still lifes in 1885. During his two-year stay in
           Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolours and nearly 200 oil paintings. His 
           palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of
           the vivid colours that distinguished his later work.</p>

    <div class="box"><p>Vincent Willem van Gogh Born 30 March 1853 â€“ 29 July 1890) was a Dutch 
        post-impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential 
        figures in the history of Western art. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including 
        around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include 
        landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and 
        dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. 
        He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at thirty-seven came after years of depression 
        and poverty.</p></div>
