          <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro; (born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who
              plays as a forward for Premier League club Manchester United and captains the Portugal national team.
              Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all 
              time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards and four European Golden Shoes, the most by European player.
              He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA 
              European Championship and one UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most goals(134) and assists
              (42) in the Champions League, most goals in th European Championship(14), and most international goals by a 
              male player(111). He is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances,

          <p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi have scored have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly
              broken the 50-goal barrier ina single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh in the individual
              merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best palyer in modern football or in the 
              history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali - Joe Frazier
              rivalry in boxing, the Borg - McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna - Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.
              Some commentators choose to analyze the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves
              around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical
              showoff, while Messi is portrayed as shy, humble character.
