          <p>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992), known as Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer 
              who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. He is widely regarded 
              as one of the best players in the world. Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional 
              debut aged 17. He helped the club win two successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 
              2011 Copa Libertadores; the latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South American 
              Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's 
              attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and 
              the UEFA Champions League, and finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 for his performances. He then 
              attained a domestic double in the 2015–16 season. In 2017, Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain in a move 
              worth €222 million, making him the most expensive player ever.[note 1] In France, Neymar won three league titles, 
              three Coupe de France, and two Coupe de la Ligue, which included a domestic treble and being voted Ligue 1 Player 
              of the Year in his debut season. Neymar helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, and led 
              the club to its first ever Champions League Final. Off the pitch, Neymar ranks among the world's most prominent 
              sportsmen. SportsPro named him the most marketable athlete in the world in 2012 and 2013, and ESPN cited him as the 
              world's fourth-most famous athlete in 2016. In 2017, Time included him in its annual list of the 100 most influential 
              people in the world. In 2018, France Football ranked Neymar the world's third highest-paid footballer. The following 
              year, Forbes ranked him the world's third highest-paid athlete, dropping a spot to fourth in 2020.

          <p>The media have often drawn comparisons between Neymar and Brazilian legend Pelé, as Neymar possesses similar attributes 
              and also like Pelé came from the Santos Youth Academy and turned heads with his skill. Neymar has said that Pelé is his 
              "role model" but also saying: "I don't like to make a comparison with Pelé". He has also been compared to compatriot Ronaldinho.

            Neymar's increasing reputation led both the media and former great players to draw comparisons between Neymar and Barcelona forward 
            Lionel Messi, which Neymar has commented on saying: "Messi is above everyone, there is no use comparing me with him. He is the best 
            player in the world and I always get inspired when I watch good football."Ronaldo stated: "Neymar is a great talent, the best we have 
            in Brazil. He is very similar to Messi." Zico said: "I see Neymar like a [Cristiano] Ronaldo or a Messi, the type who appears and makes 
            things happen." After his hat-trick in a 3–1 victory against Internacional in the Copa Libertadores and Messi's five goals scored in 
            the Champions League, Neymar said: "I am a Messi fan. I was told what he did today. I support him to score a lot of nice goals so I can 
            keep copying and imitating him."
