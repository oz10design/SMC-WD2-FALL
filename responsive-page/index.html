          <p>Lionel Andrés Messi; born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional 
              footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina 
              national team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the 
              greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European 
              Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, 
              he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, 
              including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific 
              goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga 
              and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), 
              and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the 
              record for most international goals by a South American male (79). Messi has scored over 750 senior 
              career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club.</p>

          <p>Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward 
              Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like 
              the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and 
              the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.

            Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim 
            to be the best player in the world: since 2008, Messi has won six Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five, six FIFA 
            World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four. Pundits and 
            fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players; beyond their playing styles, the debate also 
            revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and 
            contrasting public personalities, with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.
            From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among 
            the world's most viewed annual sports events.[516] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms 
            of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.</p>
